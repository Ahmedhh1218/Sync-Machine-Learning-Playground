## Project Overview

American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual and gestural language used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can recognize and classify ASL gestures based on images. The key steps of the project include data collection, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and making predictions.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- `data`: This directory contains the ASL gesture datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project, including data loading, model building, and predictions.
- `results.csv`: This CSV file contains the predictions made by the trained model.
- `model`: A directory to save the trained machine learning model.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before running the project, make sure to set up your Python environment. You can do this by installing the required dependencies mentioned in the Jupyter notebooks. To ensure reproducibility, set the random seeds for any random processes in the project.

## Data Preparation

The ASL gesture dataset is loaded, and labels are mapped to numerical values for machine learning. One-hot encoding is applied to the labels to prepare the data for training.

## Model Building

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is constructed for image classification. CNNs are ideal for image recognition tasks, and this model is designed to learn and recognize patterns in ASL gesture images.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on the labeled ASL gesture images. The training process is monitored to assess the model's performance using loss and accuracy metrics. The model is saved with its best weights during training.

## Inference and Predictions

The trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen ASL gesture images. These predictions are stored in the `results.csv` file, making it easy to analyze the model's output.

## Results

The project's results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the Jupyter notebooks. You can also explore the predictions in the `results.csv` file.


Happy coding and have fun exploring the world of ASL gestures!
