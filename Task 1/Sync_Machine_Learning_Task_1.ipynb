        "## Project Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The Restaurant Reservation Chatbot is a Python-based chatbot designed to assist users in finding and booking tables at restaurants. It provides information on restaurant menus and offers dining recommendations, enhancing the dining experience for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Table Reservations:** Users can inquire about table availability and make reservations at their preferred restaurants.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Menu Information:** The chatbot provides details about restaurant menus, including dishes, prices, and special offers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbot is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact and receive prompt responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot is developed using Python. It utilizes conditional statements and user input to navigate through various user requests, such as reservation queries and menu information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Potential Enhancements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration with restaurant booking APIs for real-time reservations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Personalized dining recommendations based on user preferences and dining history.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Expansion to a web-based or mobile app interface for wider accessibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the Restaurant Reservation Chatbot, simply run the Python script in your Jupyter Notebook or terminal. The chatbot will guide users through the process of finding and booking tables at restaurants, providing a convenient and efficient dining experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to customize and expand upon the project based on your specific requirements and preferences."
